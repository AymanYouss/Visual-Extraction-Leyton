 A visual information extraction project from invoice pdf. The pipeline is as follows:
First take the pdf as input, divide it to multiple pages and treat each page alone. This step is called data preparation. Then we move to data processing where we apply binarization of images that will go as input to image models and also quality enhancement. Then afterwards we will feed our results into different models following different paths, each path is related to a type of information (Tables ,Stamps, Checkboxes, Shapes and Lines, Graphs, Charts & Logos (Figures), Digital Signatures, Handwritten Text, Barcodes (possibly QR codes) ). Then take all the results and concatenate them back into dataset or database
